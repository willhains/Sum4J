# Sum Types for Java

This little library makes it easy to create and use sum types (a.k.a. [tagged unions][wiki]) in Java 8+, similar to Swiftâ€™s [enums with associated values][swift].

This project aims to provide:

1. A way to define a sum type with as little boilerplate code as possible.
2. Ways to use the values of sum types that are both convenient and idiomatic in Java.
3. Type safety, and other safety features.

## Define a Sum Type

1. Extend the `Sum<This>` class, where `This` is a self-reference to your own class.
2. Add a private constructor that takes a `Case` and an `Object[]` as arguments, calling the superclass constructor.
3. Add a constant for each case of your sum type, of type `Case0`, `Case1`, ...`Case9`, depending on the number of associated values it needs. The constant value is always a method reference to your private constructor.

```java
public final class Shape extends Sum<Shape>
{
	public static final Case0<Shape>                 POINT     = Shape::new;
	public static final Case1<Shape, Double>         CIRCLE    = Shape::new;
	public static final Case2<Shape, Double, Double> RECTANGLE = Shape::new;
	
	private Shape(final Case<Shape> c, final Object[] vals) { super(c, vals); }
}
```

## Use a Sum Type

You use a sum-type value similarly to how you would use an `Optional` value. First, use the `init` method to create an instance:

```java
final Shape shape = Shape.RECTANGLE.init(3.0, 5.5);
```

Then, to test the value of a sum type variable:

```java
shape.ifCase(Shape.CIRCLE, radius -> graphics.drawCircle(radius));
```

If you need to return a value:

```java
final double area = shape
	.ifCase(Shape.RECTANGLE, (width, height) -> width * height)
	.ifCase(Shape.CIRCLE,    (radius)        -> Math.PI * radius * radius)
	.orElse(0);
```

To ensure all cases are covered:

```java
final double area = shape
	.ifCase(Shape.RECTANGLE, (width, height) -> width * height)
	.ifCase(Shape.CIRCLE,    (radius)        -> Math.PI * radius * radius)
	.ifCase(Shape.POINT,     ()              -> 0)
	.orElseThrow();
```
